Attached to this lab is [a zipped collection of text files inside a directory](https://certifiedin.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/2164/samples.zip). Perform the following:

1. Unzip the directory in your lab's working directory.

2. Using your promisified functions from the previous lab, read the contents of every file in the directory.

3. Then, combine that content into a single string.

4. Write the string another file.

You must do this using without using **async / await** syntax as one sequence of chained promises. You may use `Promise.all`.
